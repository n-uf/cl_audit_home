// Links into a future page: in a markdown body, {{live:/path/}}…{{/live}} wraps a sentence that should show only
// once /path/ is built. So a link line can merge together with a draft page and appear on the day the draft goes
// live (scripts/publish-due.mjs), with no second commit. In production a draft is not built, so its block is removed;
// in dev and Vercel previews drafts are built, so the block stays.
//
// This file is plain JS with no Astro imports so that scripts/live-blocks.test.mjs can run it; src/data/live.ts
// adds the real "is this path built" lookup and is what the pages call.
//
// Build errors (each names `where`, the file, and the reason): a target that is no page at all; a nested block;
// a stray {{live: or {{/live}}; a block that spans paragraphs (or any other block element); a block in a heading
// (it would leave an empty heading, and the table of contents would show its raw markers).

"""Check the patch the scheduled publish job hands over, BEFORE it is applied.

.github/workflows/publish.yml runs in two jobs. `build` (no secret) flips due drafts with scripts/publish-due.mjs,
builds the site and uploads the flip as `git diff` output plus a page list. `push` (holds the write deploy key, runs
no node) downloads both and runs this script on them first. The patch comes from a job that ran third-party code
(npm install and build scripts), so it is treated as untrusted: it is accepted only if it is exactly what
publish-due.mjs writes, a `draft: true` -> `draft: false` change on pages that already exist, and nothing else.

Python 3 standard library only (no repo-installed tooling runs in the job that has the key).

    python3 -I scripts/check-publish-patch.py [--root <repo>] [--today YYYY-MM-DD] <patch-file> <pages-file>

  patch-file  `git diff --no-color` output of the flip
  pages-file  one `<section>/<slug>` per line (what publish-due.mjs prints), e.g. `blog/claude-usage-credits`
  --root      the checkout the patch will be applied to, a clean checkout of the commit the patch was made on
              (default: the current directory). If it is a git work tree the files are read from its HEAD, else
              from the files themselves (for tests).
  --today     the day to compare `published` with (default: today, UTC); for tests only, the workflow never sets it

Exit 0: the patch is acceptable; the commit message is the only line on stdout, `publish: blog/a, use-cases/b`
(the pages in the patch's order). Exit 1: refused, with the reason on stderr (`check-publish-patch: refused: ...`).
Exit 2: wrong usage or an unreadable input file.

The rules, all of which must hold:
  0. The patch is smaller than 64 KB (65536 bytes).
  1. Every file in the patch is a plain modification (no new, deleted, renamed or copied file, no mode change, no
     binary patch) of an existing regular file src/content/blog/<slug>.md or src/content/use-cases/<slug>.md.
     Anything the parser does not know is refused.
  2. Each file has exactly one hunk, and the hunk removes exactly one line, a top-level `draft:` line whose value
     is true (true, True or TRUE, optional trailing comment), and adds exactly one line directly after it: the same
     line with the value written as `false`. Context lines (changed nothing) are fine. The hunk must sit where its
     header says, in the HEAD version of the file, with the removed line inside the front matter (after its opening
     `---` and before its closing `---`), so a `draft: true` in the body, a code sample say, can't be flipped.
  3. The file's `published` day (a date, or a timestamp read as its UTC day, as publish-due.mjs reads it) is today
     (UTC) or earlier: nothing goes out early.
  4. The page list matches the files in the patch exactly, each page once.
